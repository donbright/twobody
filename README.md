An attempt to port John Walker's General Relativity Orbit simulator away from Java

Status: Pre-Alpha, does nothing useful yet


This program attempts to show the orbit of two objects using General 
Relativity theory of motion. One object is assumed a 'point mass' or 
'test mass' of tiny proportion The second object is assumed a 'black 
hole', non spinning. see www.fourmilab.ch for more details
